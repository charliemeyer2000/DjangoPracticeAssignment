# DjangoPracticeAssignment
This repository is of a Django Practice assignment for HooHacks that helped me learn the basics of Django to then be helpful and contribute to the HooHacks registration system.

## About
This project folllowed (loosely) a CS 3240 assignment from UVA's software development course. The Django website follows [the basic django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/tutorial01/) which creates a polls app that allows users to vote on polls, and then I also implemented another feature - the ability to submit and view deepthoughts at polls/deepthought/. This was then hosted on Heroku using Heroku hosting. 

## Visit
Currently, the website is down because of Heroku's free version not supporting the website being up constantly without paying. However, you can check out the website by cloning this repository and running it in your localhost!
