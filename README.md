# DjangoPracticeAssignment
Django Practice assignment for HooHacks.
visit the website here: https://test-website-for-onboarding.herokuapp.com/ 

this project folllowed (loosely) a CS 3240 assignment. The django website follows the basic django tutorial (creating a polls app and allowing users to vote on polls), and then I also implemented another feature - the ability to submit and view deepthoughts at polls/deepthought/. I attempted to load images - it works on localhost, but heroku is a little finicky with loading stack/relative images. So the home page should have a funny meme, but it doesn't load. Will try to fix that!
